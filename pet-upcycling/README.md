# A tool to increase the distance for plastic bottle (PET) self watering setup

The corkscrew may end up close to the bottom of the water reservoir depending of the form of the plastic bottle.

This tool simply let you move the "pot part" of the bottle a bit higher so that you can fill more water in the "reservoir part" of the bottle.

The design also allow you to transform a bottom part of a bottle to a "green house" part that is placed on top of the self watering system.
